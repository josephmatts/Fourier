# Discrete Fourier Transform
Used to extract frequency components from an input discrete function

$$ X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n . e^{\dfrac{-j2 \pi kn}{N}}$$

for each k we get a corressponding complex equation $X_k = A_k + jB_k$<br/>
These can be then laid on a spectrum plot to figure out the frequency components of the input signals.
